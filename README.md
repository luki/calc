#Calc
A basic calculator written in Rust

##Functionality
- Acception of two numbers of type *f64*
- Allowance of choosing operation

##Background
While sitting in the plane from Munich -> Amsterdam (Then PDX), I thought
I should practice some Rust and came up with writing a calculator (Basically
an application of the "Hello-World" calibre).
As Rust doesn't exactly support OOP, I have decided to go a little creative.
To me, this actually is OOP (What I have used here in order to make Calc).
